r"""Program to build a graph based on dense input features (embeddings).

This is a wrapper around the `nsl.tools.build_graph` API. See its documentation
for more details.

USAGE:

`python graph_builder.py` [*flags*] *input_features.tfr... output_graph.tsv*

For details about this program's flags, run `python graph_builder.py --help`.
